  <h2>Magento Community Edition</h2>
</div>
<p>Magento Community Edition is open source software used to power your online store and can be downloaded for free. Developers can modify the core code and add features and functionality by installing extensions from the <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect" target="_blank">Magento Connect</a>marketplace.</p>
<p>Businesses using Community Edition as their open source ecommerce solution to run their stores will want to have access to their own Magento experts, since Magento does not provide technical support for this software. Answers to many technical questions are available on our <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards">user forum</a>. Our open source community is growing and engaged to help support running your online store.</p>
<p>Mid-large size businesses that need support, additional features and our best performance should consider <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/product/enterprise-edition">Magento Enterprise Edition</a>.</p>
